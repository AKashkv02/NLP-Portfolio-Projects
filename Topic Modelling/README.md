## Topic Modeling Analysis with LDA, BERTopic, and Top2Vec on Medium Articles

**Content**:
This repository delves into the fascinating world of topic modeling in text analysis.
We explore three powerful techniques: Latent Dirichlet Allocation (LDA), BERTopic, and Top2Vec.
By applying these methods to a dataset of Medium articles obtained from the Hugging Face hub,
we aim to uncover the underlying thematic structures within the collection.


**Why Topic Modeling**?

Topic modeling is a powerful tool for identifying latent themes or topics within a corpus of documents. By analyzing word co-occurrence patterns, it helps organize large amounts of text data into meaningful categories. This enables researchers and analysts to:

Gain insights into the main themes and trends present in the data.
Generate summaries of large text collections.
Identify relationships between different topics.
Recommend similar documents to users based on thematic similarity.
Exploring Different Approaches:

This repository leverages three distinct topic modeling techniques:

**Latent Dirichlet Allocation (LDA)**: A classical statistical approach that models documents as mixtures of latent topics, with each word belonging to a topic with a certain probability.

**BERTopic**: A state-of-the-art neural network method that utilizes pre-trained language models (PLMs) to understand semantic relationships between words and discover latent topics.

**Top2Vec**: Another neural network-based technique that relies on document clustering and word embeddings to identify topics.
